    **DANGER!** A function for cleaning objects and folders on the system.

    E.g:

    >>> import snakypy
    >>> snakypy.stiff.cleaner("/tmp/foo", level=0)
    >>> snakypy.stiff.cleaner("/tmp/foo", level=1)
    >>> snakypy.stiff.cleaner("/tmp/foo", "bar.txt")

    Arguments:
        **directory {str}** -- Directory where are the files to be destroyed

        ***file** -- Enter an N file name number (Optional)

    Keyword Arguments:
        **level {int}** -- This option receives 3 values, they are: \

                           Value 0 = If this value is set, the function revokes the \
                           unitary file exclusion option, that is, this option will \
                           exclude all files at the root of the informed directory.

                           Value 1 = If this value is set, the function revokes the unitary \
                           file exclusion option as well, however, it will exclude all \
                           subdirectories of the root directory, except the files contained \
                           in the root.

                           Value None = If this value is set, the function must receive at least \
                           one file name to be deleted. Can pass as many files as you want.

                           (default: {None})
